## How to Play
The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen by hitting them with a ball. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, using left and right arrows keys, to prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen. The ball bounces off the walls and the paddle, and the player can control the direction of the ball by moving the paddle. You can pause the game at any time using the *P* key on the keyboard.

The game has five levels, each with increasing difficulty. The number of balls vary between the levels. If all the balls in a level falls off, the player loses the game. The game keeps score based on the number of blocks destroyed, and can be presented in the middle of the top bar in the game screen. Losing or winning the game will show the ending screen and the final score will be presented.
